# Guava Elm

This is an experimental port of some of the University of Chicago Guava program to Elm.

This program isn't intended for real use; it's just here for the purpose of playing with Elm.

## Viewing

Download `index.html` and `main.js` and put them in the same directory, and then open `index.html` in a browser.

## Building

With elm 0.17 installed, go to the `src` directory and run:
```
$ elm-make Main.elm --output="main.js"
```
Then open `index.html` in a browser.
